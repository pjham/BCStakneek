In this problem statement, we make an effort to model how individual choices affect the likelihood that communities will survive.
We simulate this using simple beings dubbed "macpen," which have the essential characteristics of living things:
If there is sufficient food, they can propagate.
They must eat to live.
Periodically, their food supply declines. <br>
All of this occurs in a flatland-like two-dimensional grid, where any number of macpen may live in any number of cells that mimic cities. Canteens are spawned randomly at the opening of some cells. Every hour, a portion of food is served by these canteens to all macpen occupying the cell at the moment.
There are three varieties of macpen: <br>
Helpful <br>
Ungrateful <br>
Tit-for-tat <br>
